It is easy to \\nsee that this doable given the base+offset  addressing mode that we already introduced. \\n \\n ld r1, 28(rb)  \\nwith rb initialized to 100, the above instruction accomplishes loading a[7]  into r1. \\n \\nTypically, arrays are used in loops.  In this case, there may be a loop counter (say j) that \\nmay be used to index the array.  Consider the following statement \\n \\n a[j] = a[j] + 1; \\n \\nIn the above statement, the offset to the base register is not fixed. It  is derived from the \\ncurrent value of the loop index.  While it is  possible to still generate code for loading \\na[j]2 this requires additional instructions befo re the load can be performed to compute \\nthe effective address of a[7] .  Therefore, some computer architectures provide an \\nadditional addressing mode to let the effectiv e address be computed as the sum of the \\ncontents of two registers.  This is called the base+index  addressing mode.   \\n Every new instruction and every new addressi ng mode adds to the complexity of the \\nimplementation, thus the pros and cons have to be weighed very carefully.   This is \\nusually done by doing a cost/performance analys is.  For example, to add base+index \\naddressing mode, we have to  ask the following questions: \\n \\n1. How often will this addressing mode be used during the execution of a program? \\n2. What is the advantage (in terms of num ber of instructions saved) by using \\nbase+index  versus base+offset ? \\n3. What, if any, is the penalty paid (in term s of additional time for execution) for a \\nload instruction that uses base+index  addressing compared  to base+offset \\naddressing? \\n4. What additional hardware is needed  to support base+index addressing? \\n Answers to the above questions, will quantitat ively give us a handle on whether or not \\nincluding the base+index addressi ng mode is a good idea or not. \\n We will come back to the issue of how to evaluate adding new instructions and addressing modes to the processor in late r chapters when we discuss processor \\nimplementation and performance implications. \\n                                                \\n \\n2 Basically, the loop index has to be multiplied by 4 and added to rb to get the effective address.  \\nGenerating the code for loading a[j] using only base+off set addressing mode is left as an exercise to the \\nreader.\",\n",

In this addressing mode, a memory \\naddress is computed in the instruction as th e sum of the contents of a register in the \\nprocessor (called a base register) and an o ffset (contained in the instruction as an \\nimmediate value) from that register.

Consider the following statement \\n \\n a[j] = a[j] + 1; \\n \\nIn the above statement, the offset to the base register is not fixed. It  is derived from the \\ncurrent value of the loop index.

Therefore, some computer architectures provide an \\nadditional addressing mode to let the effectiv e address be computed as the sum of the \\ncontents of two registers.  This is called the base+index  addressing mode.   \\n Every new instruction and every new addressi ng mode adds to the complexity of the \\nimplementation, thus the pros and cons have to be weighed very carefully.   This is \\nusually done by doing a cost/performance analys is.  For example, to add base+index \\naddressing mode, we have to  ask the following questions: \\n \\n1.

What, if any, is the penalty paid (in term s of additional time for execution) for a \\nload instruction that uses base+index  addressing compared  to base+offset \\naddressing? \\n4. What additional hardware is needed  to support base+index addressing? \\n Answers to the above questions, will quantitat ively give us a handle on whether or not \\nincluding the base+index addressi ng mode is a good idea or not. \\n We will come back to the issue of how to evaluate adding new instructions and addressing modes to the processor in late r chapters when we discuss processor \\nimplementation and performance implications. \\n                                                \\n \\n2 Basically, the loop index has to be multiplied by 4 and added to rb to get the effective address.  \\nGenerating the code for loading a[j] using only base+off set addressing mode is left as an exercise to the \\nreader.\\nQuestion: Compare base + offset and base + index addressing modes.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.
